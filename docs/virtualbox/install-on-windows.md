## Download Manager
Using a download manager when downloading large or multiple files simultaneously would be best, as it can help make the downloading process more efficient and reliable. Additionally, suppose you have a slower internet connection or experience frequent interruptions while downloading. In that case, a download manager can help improve your download speed and stability.

Download from 
[`https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/`](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/), 
or install a plugin for your browser

## Intel (VMX) Virtualization Technology
You may need to <span class="important-text">ENABLE</span> VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions). Check your PC firmware configuration manual on how to do this. E.g.,
